## **Schematic Overview**

**System-level design includes:**
- **ESP32-WROOM-S3** for BLE communication and GPIO-based key scanning.
- **Key matrix** arranged in rows/columns and scanned in firmware.
- **Power system**: 1000â€¯mAh LiPo battery charged via **MCP73871**.
- USB interface used for charging and potential debug access.

## **EMI Considerations**

EMI optimizations were made at the design level. No physical testing was performed.

**Design Measures:**
- Decoupling capacitors near power pins of ESP32.
- Ground pours under RF and digital sections.
- Separated high-speed signals and power lines.
- Compact trace routing to reduce emissions.
